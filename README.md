Configurable IRC Bot

## About

RJ45 is a Python IRC bot based on [CloudBot](http://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot) by [ClouDev].

## Getting and using RJ45

### Download

Get RJ45 at [https://github.com/allanice001/RJ45](https://github.com/allanice001/RJ45" "Get CloudBot from Github!").

Unzip the resulting file, and continue to read this document.

### Install

Before you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python dependencies. LXML is required while Enchant and PyDNS are needed for several plugins.


These can be installed with `pip` (The Python package manager):

    [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config` and edit it with your preferred settings.

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

`python bot.py`
