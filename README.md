Configurable IRC Bot

## About

CloudBot is a Python IRC bot based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot) by [rmmh](http://git.io/rmmh).

## Getting and using CloudBot

### Download

Get CloudBot at [https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/zipball/develop](https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/zipball/develop "Get CloudBot from Github!").

Unzip the resulting file, and continue to read this document.

### Install

Before you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python dependencies. LXML is required while Enchant and PyDNS are needed for several plugins.


These can be installed with `pip` (The Python package manager):

    [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt

#### How to install `pip`

    curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py # or download with your browser on windows
    python distribute_setup.py
    easy_install pip
    
If you are unable to use pip, there are Windows installers for LXML available for [64 bit](https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.win-amd64-py2.7.exe) and [32 bit](https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.win32-py2.7.exe) versions of Python.

### Run

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config` and edit it with your preferred settings.

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

`python bot.py`

On Windows you can usually just double-click `bot.py` to start the bot, as long as you have Python installed correctly.

### Requirements

CloudBot runs on **Python** *2.7.x*. It is currently developed on **Windows** *8* with **Python** *2.7.5*.

It **requires the Python module** lXML.
The module `Enchant` is needed for the spellcheck plugin.
The module `PyDNS` is needed for SRV record lookup in the mcping plugin.

**Windows** users: Windows compatibility some plugins is **broken** (such as ping), but we do intend to add it. Eventually.
